    <h2>How it all began</h2>
    <p>
      As a kid, I was the pickiest eater. Even though I was chubby baby, I soon
      lost all that extra weight and became very slim, opting in to play rather
      than to eat. However, this all changed when I was in 3rd grade.
    </p>
    <p>
      My mom got really sick one day, and I had to scramble to figure out food
      options for myself. As a result, I had to eat instant ramen every day. And
      I soon was so hungry that I would even eat shrimp (I hated seafood at that
      time).
    </p>
    <p>
      Fast forward to high school, I became a great sue chef by helping my
      sickly mom to cook everyday. I became well-versed in the so-called
      "eyeballing" method when it came to a lot of homecooked chinese dishes.
      But what really accelerated the growth was when COVID started. I suddenly
      found myself with a lot more time, and wanting to make the mundane days
      more interesting, I also started experiementing with cooking new recipes.
      And I loved it so much that I never stopped! Hence the beginnings of my
      foodstagram.
    </p>
    <h2>Development of Foodstagram</h2>
    <p>
      As the name states, a foodstagram is an Instagram that features food. My
      handle is @amyfannliu, which is my personal IG but I mainly only feature
      food that I made. There are no repeats and they feature the dishes that
      I've tried to make for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since I started this, I have had over 250+ posts, with 500+ followers
      (mainly my friends, as my IG is private). I am not interested in making
      this a public IG since my goal is more for personal documenting rather
      than amassing a huge following. In addition to food, I also occasionally
      post some of the art pieces that I have created as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some cuisines that I have made include: Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Korean,
      Vietnemese, American, Indian, Mexican, Dominican, Italian, Fusion,
      African, etc. These are not limited to main courses, but also include side
      dishes, appetizers, desserts, as well as drinks.
    </p>
    <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
    <p>
      As I grow older, I still love to experiement and try out new recipes. I am
      always open to suggestions, and sometimes I get inspired by the food I had
      a particular restaurant, and would go out of my way to replicate it. One
      example is the melted cheese over a rich kalbijjim (Korean braised beef
      short rib stew) from Daeho, I have been able to create my own spicy
      version mixed in with sweet potato noodles.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of that goes to say that I am still open to suggestions! If there is
      anything you want to see me try to make, feel free to submit in my form
      above!
